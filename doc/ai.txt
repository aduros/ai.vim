*ai.txt* Plugin for generating and editing text using OpenAI and GPT.

Author: Bruno Garcia <https://github.com/aduros/ai.vim>

==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION

*ai.vim* exposes OpenAI's powerful language processing model to Neovim in a
flexible but easy to use plugin.

You'll need an OpenAI account and to generate an API key here:

        https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys

Then set the `$OPEN_AI_API_KEY` environment variable, for example, by adding
it to your `~/.profile`:

        `export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890"`

==============================================================================
USAGE

The *:AI* command is your point of entry to ai.vim. With it you can generate
text using a prompt, complete text at the current position, or edit existing
text in-place.

There is a recommended mapping of *<CTRL-A>* in normal, visual, and insert
modes. This mapping can be disabled by setting *g:ai_no_mappings* to 1.

There are 4 different behaviors for :AI based on whether arguments are
supplied or text is visually selected.

:AI {generator prompt}

        Generate some text using the supplied prompt and insert it at the
        cursor position.

        Example:

            :AI write an email to IT asking for a replacement laptop

:AI

        When no prompt is supplied, contextually complete some text to insert
        at the cursor position.

        Example:

            function capitalize (str: string): string {
                `(Press <Ctrl-A> here)`
            }

(with visual selection) :AI {edit instruction}

        With some text visually selected, edit it in-place using the given
        edit instruction.

        Example:

            List of capitals:
            1. Toronto
            2. London
            3. Honolulu
            4. Miami
            5. Boston

            `(Visual select)` :AI sort by population

(with visual selection) :AI

        When no edit instruction is supplied, use the selected text as a
        generator prompt. The generated text will replace the selected text.

        Example:

            Write an academic essay exploring the pros and cons of yodeling as
            a career choice.

            `(Visual select)` :AI

CUSTOMIZING

*g:ai_completions_model* (default: "text-davinci-003")

        The model to use for completions.

        For more info, see https://beta.openai.com/docs/models/overview

        Example: `let g:ai_completions_model="text-ada-001"`

*g:ai_edits_model* (default: "text-davinci-edit-001")

        The model to use for edits.

        For more info, see https://beta.openai.com/docs/models/overview

        Example: `let g:ai_edits_model="code-davinci-edit-001"`

*g:ai_temperature* (default: 0)

        Controls randomness of output, between 0 and 1. Lower values will be
        more deterministic and higher values will take more creative risks.

        Example: `let g:ai_temperature=0.7`

*g:ai_context_before* (default: 20)

        When using |:AI| for contextual completion, how many additional lines
        of text before the cursor to include in the request.

        Example: `let g:ai_context_before=50`

*g:ai_context_after* (default: 20)

        When using |:AI| for contextual completion, how many additional lines
        of text after the cursor to include in the request.

        Example: `let g:ai_context_after=50`

*g:ai_indicator_style* (default: "sign")

        Controls where the progress indicator is displayed. Allowed values:

            - `sign`: Display indicator in the sign column.
            - `none`: Don't display any indicator.

        Example: `let g:ai_indicator_style="none"`

*g:ai_indicator_text* (default: "🤖")

        The text used to indicate a request in-progress. If your terminal can't
        display emojis, you'll probably want to set this.

        Example: `let g:ai_indicator_text="A"`

*g:ai_timeout* (default: 10)

        Set the maximum time to wait for the operation to complete.

        Example: `let g:ai_timeout=20`

*AIIndicator* is the |:highlight| group to color the indicator text.

        Example: `:highlight AIIndicator ctermbg=red`

*AIHighlight* is the |:highlight| group to color the text being processed.

        Example: `:highlight AIHighlight ctermbg=green`
